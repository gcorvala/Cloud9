@article{Canny1986,
abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

@article{Audette2000,
abstract = {This paper presents a literature survey of automatic 3D surface registration techniques emphasizing the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of the subject. The relevance of surface registration to medical imaging is that there is much useful anatomical information in the form of collected surface points which originate from complimentary modalities and which must be reconciled. Surface registration can be roughly partitioned into three issues: choice of transformation, elaboration of surface representation and similarity criterion, and matching and global optimization. The first issue concerns the assumptions made about the nature of relationships between the two modalities, e.g. whether a rigid-body assumption applies, and if not, what type and how general a relation optimally maps one modality onto the other. The second issue determines what type of information we extract from the 3D surfaces, which typically characterizes their local or global shape, and how we organize this information into a representation of the surface which will lead to improved efficiency and robustness in the last stage. The last issue pertains to how we exploit this information to estimate the transformation which best aligns local primitives in a globally consistent manner or which maximizes a measure of the similarity in global shape of two surfaces. Within this framework, this paper discusses in detail each surface registration issue and reviews the state-of-the-art among existing techniques.},
